Every day I start my day out by journaling, a common practice that is used to help one get prepared for their day. This has been a part of my daily routine for quite a long time - nearly a decade at this point.

My daily journal routine is pretty important to me, as you can imagine. I am going to share my workflow and show you how I use journaling to prepare myself for the day!
